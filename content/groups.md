<p>Onion routing and Tor were invented at NRL, and researchers in the Formal
Methods Section continue to investigate ways to improve communications privacy
in general and Tor in particular. Topics of recent activity include improving
Tor’s performance (e.g. congestion handling and bandwidth measurement),
improved Tor’s security (e.g. improved guard-selection algorithms), improved
onion services (e.g. single onion services and onion-service naming), and
better Tor measurements (e.g. PrivCount and onion-service statistics). In
addition, the Shadow network simulator is developed and maintained by the
group.</p>

<p>The group comprised expertise across all filed of security, cryptography and
privacy, including the study of anonymous communications, traffic analysis,
censorship resistance, measurement studies, and privacy related cryptography.
In related areas the group studies human factors and usability of privacy systems,
genetic privacy, infrastructure privacy and abuse in online communities and
media.</p>

<p>The group has worked on several projects seeking methods to improve
Tor's performance and to understand the degradation of anonymity
resulting from these methods. This includes understanding attacks on
and improvements to many mechanisms used by Tor to improve
performance, including load balancing, admission control, congestion
control, hidden services, circuit selection, and circuit scheduling.
We have also worked on accurately measuring and modeling the Tor
network. Our group developed shadow, a network emulator that allows
accurate large-scale simulations of Tor's performance and security,
and developed algorithms for producing accurate reduced-scale models
of the network. We have recently worked to develop methods for
privately measuring improved models of Tor network traffic. Finally,
the group has recently worked on understanding the limitations of website
fingerprinting attacks and possible mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>The CrySP research group at the University of Waterloo has been
researching privacy-preserving communications networks for over a
decade. They work on improving the security, privacy, and performance of
such networks, and a number of their results have been incorporated into
the Tor network.  They also work on improved testbeds for Tor
experimentation, including Shadow and NetMirage.  The group maintains
the CrySP RIPPLE Facility, a large experimentation testbed for privacy
enhancing technologies like Tor; the largest single machine in the
facility has 144 CPU cores and 12 TB of RAM.</p>
